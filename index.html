            <h1>Safety Measures for People Scared of Dogs</h1>
            <p>If you are scared of dogs, there are some safety measures you can take to feel more comfortable around them.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learn about dog body language.</li>
              <li>Avoid direct eye contact with dogs.</li>
              <li>Don't run away from dogs.</li>
              <li>Speak in a calm and reassuring voice.</li>
              <li>If a dog approaches you, stand still with your hands at your sides.</li>
              <li>If a dog starts to bark or growl, leave the area immediately.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is also important to remember that not all dogs are aggressive. Many dogs are friendly and love to be petted. If you are feeling nervous around a dog, it is always best to ask the owner if it is okay to pet the dog.</p>
